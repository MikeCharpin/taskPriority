# Tulip Tasks User Instructions

**Welcome to Tulip Tasks!** This guide will help you understand how to use the app to prioritize and manage your tasks effectively.

## 1. Overview of Tulip Tasks

Tulip Tasks is designed to help you manage a large workload by organizing your tasks, projects, and goals, and suggesting priorities based on the information you provide.

## 2. Understanding the Structure

- **Goals:** These are your long-term objectives, typically things you want to achieve within one to six months or longer.
- **Projects:** These are medium-term tasks that may take days to weeks to complete. Projects fall under your goals.
- **Tasks:** The smallest units, these are individual actions that take less than a day to accomplish and are part of your projects.

## 3. Adding and Editing Goals

- To add or edit a goal, use the Goal Form.
- Each goal is rated based on:
  - **Complexity:** How difficult the goal is (e.g., piece of cake, requires some tools, rocket science).
  - **Excitement Level:** How you feel about the goal (e.g., pumped, neutral, anxious).
- The larger the goal and the more excited you are, the higher the score.

## 4. Managing Projects

- Projects can be added or edited similarly to goals.
- You can assign a target date to each project to help track deadlines.
- Projects also use the same complexity and excitement metrics as goals to help prioritize them.

## 5. Tasks

- Tasks are the specific actions required to complete a project.
- Although tasks donâ€™t affect the scoring, they help you keep track of your daily to-dos and set up future features.

## 6. Prioritizing with the How About List

- The How About List is your dynamically generated priority list.
- Priorities are determined based on the input data, with higher scores pushing items to the top of the list.
- This list reflects the importance and urgency of your goals and projects.

## 7. Adjusting Priorities

- You can modify your priorities by updating the importance levels of your goals and projects.
- As you adjust, the How About List recalculates and reorganizes to reflect your current priorities.

## 8. Getting Started

- When you first log in, youâ€™ll see the app in offline mode.
- Click the **Login** button, enter your email address, and youâ€™ll receive an email to create an account.
- Once logged in, your data will be saved, allowing you to access and update it anytime.

## 9. Providing Feedback

- Use the **Send Feedback** button to submit suggestions, report bugs, or share your thoughts via a Google Form.
